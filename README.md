# EAN_REST_API
REST API built using Spring framework that allows the retrieval of product information from barcodes (EAN) as well as making CRUD petitions to the entities involved 
(Products and Provider).

# Introduction

The digits indicated with P refer to the supplier that manufactures the product. The digits indicated with N refer to the product code and the digit indicated with D refers to a destination digit.
